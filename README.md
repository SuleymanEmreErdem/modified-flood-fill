# modified-flood-fill
A Micromouse maze solving algorithm that uses flood-fill for use with mackorone/mms, a Micromouse simulator.
It floods the grid and after each move it updates the flood according to the data of explored walls.
After 3 runs it finally runs on the optimised path without updating the path.
